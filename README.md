## General Information
- This project targets on analysing data available against loans in a finance company. We will be analyzing major parameters involved in making a decision whether or not a loan sanction will be good for business.
- Background: We have data available of loans from 2007 to 2011 and parameters of each loan. We need to identify which parameters can be useful in identifying loan is risky. 
- Our focus is to identify parameters which will help finance company decide if loan is risky based on data available of approved loans. 
- Dataset used consists of all loans from 2007 to 2011.

## Conclusions
- Each graph gives insight on attirbutes (parameters)
- We can observe patterns in graph and decide if loan can be risky or not
- Type driven metric alone are not good indicator to have definitive conclusion
- Data driven and business driven metrics work best here, provide more insights when coupled with other attributes (parameters).
